These datasets are used in machine learning (ML) research and have been cited in peer-reviewed academic journals . Datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning ), computer hardware , and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets. [ 1 ] High-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Many organizations, including governments, publish and share their datasets . The datasets are classified, based on the licenses, as Open data and Non-Open data .
The datasets from various governmental-bodies are presented in List of open government data sites . The datasets are ported on open data portals . They are made available for searching, depositing and accessing through interfaces like Open API .  The datasets are made available as various sorted types and subtypes.
List of sorting used for datasets
The data portal is classified based on its type of license. The open source license based data portals are known as open data portals which are used by many government organizations and academic institutions .

OpenReACT-CHON-EFH
OpenReACT-CHON-EFH ( O pen Re action Dataset of A tomic C onfigura T ions comprising C , H , O and N with E nergies, F orces and H essians) is a 2025 open-access benchmark for machine-learning interatomic potentials.
**RTP set** – 35,087 stationary-point geometries (reactant, transition state and product) drawn from 11,961 elementary reactions, each labeled with density-functional energies, atomic forces and full Hessian matrices at the ωB97X-D/6-31G(d) level.
**IRC set** – 34,248 structures along 600 minimum-energy reaction paths, used to test extrapolation beyond trained stationary points.
**NMS set** – 62,527 off-equilibrium geometries generated by normal-mode sampling to probe model robustness under thermal perturbations.
The collection underpins the study Does Hessian Data Improve the Performance of Machine Learning Potentials? and was used to train and benchmark the machine-learning interatomic potentials reported therein. [ 202 ]
The dataset itself is distributed under a CC licence via Figshare. [ 203 ]

Curated repositories of datasets
As datasets come in myriad formats and can sometimes be difficult to use, there has been considerable work put into curating and standardizing the format of datasets to make them easier to use for machine learning research.
OpenML: [ 502 ] Web platform with Python, R, Java, and other APIs for downloading hundreds of machine learning datasets, evaluating algorithms on datasets, and benchmarking algorithm performance against dozens of other algorithms.
PMLB: [ 503 ] A large, curated repository of benchmark datasets for evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms. Provides classification and regression datasets in a standardized format that are accessible through a Python API.
Metatext NLP: https://metatext.io/datasets web repository maintained by community, containing nearly 1000 benchmark datasets, and counting. Provides many tasks from classification to QA, and various languages from English, Portuguese to Arabic.
Appen : Off The Shelf and Open Source Datasets hosted and maintained by the company. These biological, image, physical, question answering, signal, sound, text, and video resources number over 250 and can be applied to over 25 different use cases. [ 504 ] [ 505 ]
