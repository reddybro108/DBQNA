-----
A large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation . LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.
This page lists notable large language models.

For the training cost column, 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP/sec Ã— 1 day = 8.64E19 FLOP. Also, only the largest model's cost is written.
