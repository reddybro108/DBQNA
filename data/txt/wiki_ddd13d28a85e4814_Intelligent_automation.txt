Intelligent automation ( IA ), or intelligent process automation , is a software term that refers to a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation (RPA). [ 1 ] Companies use intelligent automation to cut costs and streamline tasks by using artificial-intelligence-powered robotic software to mitigate repetitive tasks. [ 1 ] As it accumulates data, the system learns in an effort to improve its efficiency. [ 2 ] Intelligent automation applications consist of but are not limited to, pattern analysis, data assembly, and classification. [ 2 ] The term is similar to hyperautomation , a concept identified by research group Gartner as being one of the top technology trends of 2020. [ 3 ]
Technology
Intelligent automation applies the assembly line concept of breaking tasks into repetitive steps to improve business processes. [ 4 ] Rather than having humans do each step, intelligent automation can replace steps with an intelligent software robot or bot, improving efficiency. [ 5 ]
Applications
The technology is used to process unstructured content.  Common real-world applications include self-driving cars, self-checkouts at grocery stores, smart home assistants, and appliances. [ 6 ] Businesses can apply data and machine learning to build predictive analytics that react to consumer behavior changes, or to implement RPA to improve manufacturing floor operations. [ 6 ]
For example, the technology has also been used to automate the workflow behind distributing Covid-19 vaccines.  Data provided by hospital systems’ electronic health records can be processed to identify and educate patients, and schedule vaccinations. [ 7 ]
Intelligent Automation can provide real-time insights on profitability and efficiency. However in an April 2022 survey by Alchemmy , despite three quarters of businesses acknowledging the importance of Artificial Intelligence to their future development, just a quarter of business leaders (25%) considered Intelligent Automation a “game changer” in understanding current performance. 42% of CTOs see “shortage of talent” as the main obstacle to implementing Intelligent Automation in their business, while 36% of CEOs see ‘upskilling and professional development of existing workforce’ as the most significant adoption barrier. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
IA is becoming increasingly accessible for firms of all sizes. With this in mind, it is expected to continue to grow rapidly in all industries. [ 10 ] This technology has the potential to change the workforce. As it advances, it will be able to perform increasingly complex and difficult tasks. [ 11 ] In addition, this may expose certain workforce issues as well as change how tasks are allocated. [ 12 ]
Benefits
Streamline Processes
Repetitive manual tasks can put a strain on the workforce, these tasks can be automated to allow the workforce to work on more important matters that require human cognition. [ 11 ] Intelligent automation can also be used to mitigate tasks with human error which in turn increases proficiency. [ 11 ] This allows the opportunity for firms to scale production without the traditional negative consequences such as reduced quality or increased risk. [ 12 ]
Customer Service Improvement
Customers service can be improved drastically, this allows for a competitive advantage for the firm. [ 12 ] IA utilizing chat features allows for instant curated responses to customers. [ 12 ] In addition, it can give updates to customers, make appointments, manage calls, and personalize campaigns. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Flexibility
Due to the wide range of applications, IA is useful across a variety of fields, technologies, projects and industries. [ 10 ] In addition, IA can be integrated with current automated systems in place. [ 10 ] This allows for optimized systems unique to each firm to best fit their individual needs. [ 10 ]
