The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World is a book by Pedro Domingos released in 2015. Domingos wrote the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field.
Overview
The book outlines five approaches of machine learning: inductive reasoning , connectionism , evolutionary computation , Bayes' theorem and analogical modelling . The author explains these tribes to the reader by referring to more understandable processes of logic , connections made in the brain , natural selection , probability and similarity judgments. Throughout the book, it is suggested that each different tribe has the potential to contribute to a unifying "master algorithm".
Towards the end of the book the author pictures a "master algorithm " in the near future, where machine learning algorithms asymptotically grow to a perfect understanding of how the world and people in it work. [ 1 ] Although the algorithm doesn't yet exist, he briefly reviews his own invention of the Markov logic network . [ 2 ]
In the media
In 2016 Bill Gates recommended the book, alongside Nick Bostrom 's Superintelligence , as one of two books everyone should read to understand AI. [ 3 ] In 2018 the book was noted to be on Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping 's bookshelf. [ 4 ]
Reception
A computer science educator stated in Times Higher Education that the examples are clear and accessible. [ 5 ] In contrast, The Economist agreed Domingos "does a good job" but complained that he "constantly invents metaphors that grate or confuse". [ 6 ] Kirkus Reviews praised the book, stating that "Readers unfamiliar with logic and computer theory will have a difficult time, but those who persist will discover fascinating insights." [ 7 ]
A New Scientist review called it "compelling but rather unquestioning". [ 8 ]
