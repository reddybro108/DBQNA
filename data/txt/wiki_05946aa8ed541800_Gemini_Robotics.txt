Gemini Robotics is an advanced vision-language-action model developed by Google DeepMind [ 1 ] in partnership with Apptronik. [ 2 ] It is based on the Gemini 2.0 large language model. [ 3 ] It is tailored for robotics applications and can understand new situations. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] There is a related version called Gemini Robotics-ER , which stands for embodied reasoning. [ 3 ] The two models were launched on March 12, 2025. [ 5 ]
On June 24, 2025, Google DeepMind released Gemini Robotics On-Device, a variant designed and optimized to run locally on robotic devices. [ 6 ]
Access to Gemini Robotics models is currently restricted to trusted testers, including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. [ 2 ]
