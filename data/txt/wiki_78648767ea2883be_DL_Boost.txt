Intel 's Deep Learning Boost ( DL Boost ) is a marketing name for instruction set architecture (ISA) features on the x86-64 designed to improve performance on deep learning tasks such as training and inference. [ 1 ]
Features
DL Boost consists of two sets of features:
AVX-512 VNNI , 4VNNIW, or AVX-VNNI : fast multiply-accumulation mainly for convolutional neural networks .
AVX-512 BF16: lower-precision bfloat16 floating-point numbers for generally faster computation. Operations provided include conversion to/from float32 and dot product .
DL Boost features were introduced in the Cascade Lake architecture.
A TensorFlow -based benchmark run on the Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine shows improved performance and reduced cost compared to previous CPUs and to GPUs, especially for small batch sizes. [ 2 ]
