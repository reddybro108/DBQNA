HeyGen is a generative artificial intelligence company that creates photo-realistic avatars via user-submitted photos and videos as well as a library of pre-made avatars and voices. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The digital avatar can recite prompts in multiple languages. [ 1 ] [ 3 ]
When submitting content to be used in the generation of a video, users are required to give verbal consent, along with a spoken password to verify their identity. Human moderators are used to remove and block any content used for the purpose of bullying, harassment, and the spread of disinformation , [ 4 ] in addition to the use of an automated content filter. [ 1 ]
