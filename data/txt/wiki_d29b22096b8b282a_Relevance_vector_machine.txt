In mathematics , a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inference to obtain parsimonious solutions for regression and probabilistic classification . [ 1 ] A greedy optimisation procedure and thus fast version were subsequently developed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The RVM has an identical functional form to the support vector machine , but provides probabilistic classification.
It is actually equivalent to a Gaussian process model with covariance function :
where φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is the kernel function (usually Gaussian), α j {\displaystyle \alpha _{j}} are the variances of the prior on the weight vector w ∼ N ( 0 , α − 1 I ) {\displaystyle w\sim N(0,\alpha ^{-1}I)} , and x 1 , … , x N {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {x} _{N}} are the input vectors of the training set . [ 4 ]
Compared to that of support vector machines (SVM), the Bayesian formulation of the RVM avoids the set of free parameters of the SVM (that usually require cross-validation-based post-optimizations). However RVMs use an expectation maximization (EM)-like learning method and are therefore at risk of local minima. This is unlike the standard sequential minimal optimization (SMO)-based algorithms employed by SVMs , which are guaranteed to find a global optimum (of the convex problem).
The relevance vector machine was patented in the United States by Microsoft (patent expired September 4, 2019). [ 5 ]
