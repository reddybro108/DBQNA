Ernie Bot ( Chinese : 文心一言 , Pinyin : wénxīn yīyán ), full name Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration , [ 1 ] is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the Chinese technology company Baidu . It is built on the company's ERNIE series of large language models , which have been in development since 2019. The service was first launched for invited testing on March 16, 2023, [ 2 ] and was released to the general public on August 31, 2023, after receiving approval from Chinese regulators. [ 3 ]
Since its public launch, Ernie Bot has undergone several updates, with newer versions like ERNIE 4.0 and 4.5 released to improve its capabilities. The service has seen rapid user adoption, reportedly reaching over 200 million users by April 2024.
