Cohere Inc. is a Canadian multinational technology company focused on artificial intelligence . Cohere specializes in large language models and AI products for regulated industries, particularly the finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy fields, as well as the public sector.  Cohere was founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez , Ivan Zhang, and Nick Frosst and is headquartered in Toronto and San Francisco , with offices in Montreal , London , and New York City .
History
In 2017, a team of researchers at Google Brain introduced the transformer machine learning architecture in " Attention Is All You Need ," which demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2019, Aidan Gomez, one of its co-authors, along with Nick Frosst, [ 8 ] another researcher at Google Brain, founded Cohere with Ivan Zhang, with whom Gomez had done research at FOR.ai. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] All of the co-founders attended University of Toronto . [ 11 ]
Gomez is the company's CEO. [ 10 ] In December 2022, Martin Kon, the former CFO of YouTube , became president and COO. [ 12 ]
In November 2021, Google Cloud announced that they would help power Cohere's platform using their robust infrastructure, and Cloud's TPUs would be used by Cohere for the development and deployment of their products. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
In June 2022, Cohere launched Cohere For AI, a nonprofit research lab and community dedicated to contributing open-source, fundamental machine learning research. It is led by Sara Hooker , a former research scientist at Google Brain. [ 15 ]
In December 2022, Cohere released a multilingual model for understanding text that would work with over 100 languages, to help users search for documents by meaning instead of with keywords. This type of process was not previously widely available in languages other than English. [ 12 ]
On September 12, 2023, it was announced that Cohere had become one of fifteen tech companies to agree to sign on to a voluntary White House commitment on measures for testing, reporting, and research on the risks of AI. [ 16 ] On September 27, 2023, it was announced that Cohere had also signed Canada's voluntary code of conduct for AI, to promote the responsible development and management of advanced generative AI systems. [ 17 ] In May 2025, Cohere acquired Ottogrid, a Vancouver-based platform that develops enterprise tools for automating certain kinds of high-level market research. [ 18 ]
In 2024, Cohere opened a new office in New York City. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In 2025, they later expanded to Montreal, Canada. [ 22 ]
In June 2025, it was announced that Cohere had partnered with the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom to expand the use of AI in the public sector. [ 23 ]
Products
Considered an alternative to OpenAI , [ 24 ] Cohere is focused on generative AI for the enterprise, building technology that businesses can use to deploy chatbots, search engines, copywriting, summarization, and other AI-driven products. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Cohere specializes in large language models : AI trained to digest text from an enterprises' internal data or publicly available sources like the internet to understand how to process and respond to prompts with increasing sophistication. [ 12 ]
The Cohere platform is available through API as a managed service, through platforms such as Amazon SageMaker and Google's Vertex AI. It can be used for tasks such as writing copy, moderating content, classifying data, and extracting information. It is cloud agnostic and not tied to a particular cloud service. [ 10 ]
Cohere's generative AI technology is embedded into several Oracle products, and its chat capabilities are embedded into Salesforce products. [ 24 ]
In March of 2025, Cohere's nonprofit research lab introduced Aya Vision, an AI model that can describe images, translate text, and summarize information. The model is free to use for research but is not permitted to be used for commercial purposes. [ 27 ]
Partnerships
On June 13, 2023, Oracle announced a partnership with Cohere to provide generative AI services to help organizations automate end-to-end business processes. As a result, Cohere's technology is integrated into Oracle's business applications, including Oracle Fusion Cloud, Oracle NetSuite, and Oracle industry-specific applications. [ 28 ] McKinsey announced a collaboration with Cohere, to help organizations integrate generative AI into their operations on July 18, 2023. [ 29 ] Cohere also partnered with software company LivePerson to offer customized large language models for businesses in 2023. [ 25 ] here
In 2024, Cohere partnered with Fujitsu in co-developing Takane, a Japanese LLM. [ 30 ] [ 31 ]
In January 2025, in partnership with RBC , Cohere introduced North for Banking, a secure generative AI platform designed to enhance productivity and data security in financial services. [ 32 ] A partnership with LG developed a Korean LLM and customized the North platform for the specific needs of  Korean companies. [ 33 ] In May 2025, Cohere partnered with SAP to integrate its AI models into SAP's Business Suite and make them available through SAP AI Core's generative AI hub. [ 34 ] Simultaneously, Cohere announced a collaboration with Dell Technologies, making Dell the first infrastructure provider to offer Cohere North, the company's secure AI workspace platform, for on-premises deployment. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Cohere also entered the healthcare sector through a partnership with Ensemble Health Partners, a revenue cycle management company, to deploy agentic AI solutions for healthcare providers' administrative workflows. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
In July 2025, Cohere announced a partnership with Bell Canada to provide AI services to government and enterprise customers. Under the agreement, Bell Canada will deploy Cohere's technology on its data center infrastructure and offer AI solutions to clients. The partnership positions the services as a Canadian alternative to international cloud providers, with Bell also implementing Cohere's North platform for internal operations. [ 39 ]
