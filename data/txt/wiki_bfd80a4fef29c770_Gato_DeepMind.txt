Gato is a deep neural network for a range of complex tasks that exhibits multimodality . It can perform tasks such as engaging in a dialogue, playing video games, controlling a robot arm to stack blocks, and more. It was created by researchers at London-based AI firm DeepMind . It is a transformer , like GPT-3 . [ 1 ] According to MIT Technology Review , the system "learns multiple different tasks at the same time, which means it can switch between them without having to forget one skill before learning another" whereas "[t]he AI systems of today are called “narrow,” meaning they can only do a specific, restricted set of tasks such as generate text", [ 2 ] and according to The Independent , it is a "'generalist agent' that can carry out a huge range of complex tasks, from stacking blocks to writing poetry". [ 3 ] It uses supervised learning with 1.2B parameters. [ 4 ] The technology has been described as "general purpose" artificial intelligence and a "step toward" artificial general intelligence . [ 5 ]
