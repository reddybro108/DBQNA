Generative Pre-trained Transformer 1 ( GPT-1 ) was the first of OpenAI 's large language models following Google 's invention of the transformer architecture in 2017. [ 2 ] In June 2018, OpenAI released a paper entitled "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training", [ 3 ] in which they introduced that initial model along with the general concept of a generative pre-trained transformer . [ 4 ]
Up to that point, the best-performing neural NLP models primarily employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually labeled data. This reliance on supervised learning limited their use of datasets that were not well-annotated, in addition to making it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large models; [ 3 ] [ 5 ] many languages (such as Swahili or Haitian Creole ) are difficult to translate and interpret using such models due to a lack of available text for corpus-building. [ 5 ] In contrast, a GPT's "semi-supervised" approach involved two stages: an unsupervised generative "pre-training" stage in which a language modeling objective was used to set initial parameters, and a supervised discriminative "fine-tuning" stage in which these parameters were adapted to a target task. [ 3 ]
The use of a transformer architecture, as opposed to previous techniques involving attention-augmented RNNs, provided GPT models with a more structured memory than could be achieved through recurrent mechanisms; this resulted in "robust transfer performance across diverse tasks". [ 3 ]
Architecture
The GPT-1 architecture is a twelve-layer decoder-only transformer , using twelve masked self-attention heads, with 64-dimensional states each (for a total of 768). Rather than simple stochastic gradient descent , the Adam optimization algorithm was used; the learning rate was increased linearly from zero over the first 2,000 updates to a maximum of 2.5×10 −4 , and annealed to 0 using a cosine schedule. [ 3 ] GPT-1 has 117 million parameters. [ 4 ]
While the fine-tuning was adapted to specific tasks, its pre-training was not; to perform the various tasks, minimal changes were performed to its underlying task-agnostic model architecture. [ 3 ] Despite this, GPT-1 still improved on previous benchmarks in several language processing tasks, outperforming discriminatively-trained models with task-oriented architectures on several diverse tasks. [ 3 ]
Performance and evaluation
GPT-1 achieved a 5.8% and 1.5% improvement over previous best results [ 3 ] on natural language inference (also known as textual entailment ) tasks, evaluating the ability to interpret pairs of sentences from various datasets and classify the relationship between them as "entailment", "contradiction" or "neutral". [ 3 ] Examples of such datasets include QNLI ( Wikipedia articles) and MultiNLI (transcribed speech, popular fiction, and government reports, among other sources); [ 6 ] It similarly outperformed previous models on two tasks related to question answering and commonsense reasoning —by 5.7% on RACE, [ 7 ] a dataset of written question-answer pairs from middle and high school exams, and by 8.9% on the Story Cloze Test . [ 8 ]
GPT-1 improved on previous best-performing models by 4.2% on semantic similarity (or paraphrase detection ), evaluating the ability to predict whether two sentences are paraphrases of one another, using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset. [ 3 ]
GPT-1 achieved a score of 45.4, versus a previous best of 35.0 [ 3 ] in a text classification task using the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA). Finally, GPT-1 achieved an overall score of 72.8 (compared to a previous record of 68.9) on GLUE, a multi-task test. [ 9 ]
