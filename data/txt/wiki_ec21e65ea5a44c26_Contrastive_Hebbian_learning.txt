Contrastive Hebbian learning is a biologically plausible form of Hebbian learning .
It is based on the contrastive divergence algorithm, which has been used to train a variety of energy-based latent variable models.
In 2003, contrastive Hebbian learning was shown to be equivalent in power to the backpropagation algorithms commonly used in machine learning .
