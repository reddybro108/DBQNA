Riffusion is a neural network , designed by Seth Forsgren and Hayk Martiros, that generates music using images of sound rather than audio. [ 1 ]
The resulting music has been described as " de otro mundo " (otherworldly), [ 2 ] although unlikely to replace man-made music. [ 2 ] The model was made available on December 15, 2022, with the code also freely available on GitHub . [ 3 ]
The first version of Riffusion was created as a fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion , an existing open-source model for generating images from text prompts, on spectrograms , [ 1 ] resulting in a model which used text prompts to generate image files which could then be put through an inverse Fourier transform and converted into audio files. [ 3 ] While these files were only several seconds long, the model could also use latent space between outputs to interpolate different files together [ 1 ] [ 4 ] (using the img2img capabilities of SD). [ 5 ] It was one of many models derived from Stable Diffusion. [ 5 ]
In December 2022, Mubert [ 6 ] similarly used Stable Diffusion to turn descriptive text into music loops. In January 2023, Google published a paper on their own text-to-music generator called MusicLM. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Forsgren and Martiros formed a startup, also called Riffusion, and raised $4 million in venture capital funding in October 2023. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
