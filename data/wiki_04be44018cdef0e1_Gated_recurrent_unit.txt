In artificial neural networks , the gated recurrent unit ( GRU ) is a gating mechanism used in recurrent neural networks , introduced in 2014 by Kyunghyun Cho et al. [ 1 ] The GRU is like a long short-term memory (LSTM) with a gating mechanism to input or forget certain features, [ 2 ] but lacks a context vector or output gate, resulting in fewer parameters than LSTM. [ 3 ] GRU's performance on certain tasks of polyphonic music modeling, speech signal modeling and natural language processing was found to be similar to that of LSTM. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] GRUs showed that gating is indeed helpful in general, and Bengio 's team came to no concrete conclusion on which of the two gating units was better. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Architecture
There are several variations on the full gated unit, with gating done using the previous hidden state and the bias in various combinations, and a simplified form called minimal gated unit. [ 8 ]
In the following, the operator ⊙ {\displaystyle \odot } denotes the Hadamard product .
Fully gated unit
Initially, for t = 0 {\displaystyle t=0} , the output vector is h 0 = 0 {\displaystyle h_{0}=0} .
Variables ( d {\displaystyle d} denotes the number of input features and e {\displaystyle e} the number of output features):
x t ∈ R d {\displaystyle x_{t}\in \mathbb {R} ^{d}} : input vector
h t ∈ R e {\displaystyle h_{t}\in \mathbb {R} ^{e}} : output vector
h ^ t ∈ R e {\displaystyle {\hat {h}}_{t}\in \mathbb {R} ^{e}} : candidate activation vector
z t ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) e {\displaystyle z_{t}\in (0,1)^{e}} : update gate vector
r t ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) e {\displaystyle r_{t}\in (0,1)^{e}} : reset gate vector
W ∈ R e × d {\displaystyle W\in \mathbb {R} ^{e\times d}} , U ∈ R e × e {\displaystyle U\in \mathbb {R} ^{e\times e}} and b ∈ R e {\displaystyle b\in \mathbb {R} ^{e}} : parameter matrices and vector which need to be learned during training
Activation functions
σ {\displaystyle \sigma } : The original is a logistic function .
ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } : The original is a hyperbolic tangent .
Alternative activation functions are possible, provided that σ ( x ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \sigma (x)\in [0,1]} .
Alternate forms can be created by changing z t {\displaystyle z_{t}} and r t {\displaystyle r_{t}} [ 9 ]
Type 1: each gate depends only on the previous hidden state and the bias. z t = σ ( U z h t − 1 + b z ) r t = σ ( U r h t − 1 + b r ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z_{t}&=\sigma (U_{z}h_{t-1}+b_{z})\\r_{t}&=\sigma (U_{r}h_{t-1}+b_{r})\\\end{aligned}}}
Type 2: each gate depends only on  the previous hidden state. z t = σ ( U z h t − 1 ) r t = σ ( U r h t − 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z_{t}&=\sigma (U_{z}h_{t-1})\\r_{t}&=\sigma (U_{r}h_{t-1})\\\end{aligned}}}
Type 3: each gate is computed using only the bias. z t = σ ( b z ) r t = σ ( b r ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z_{t}&=\sigma (b_{z})\\r_{t}&=\sigma (b_{r})\\\end{aligned}}}
Minimal gated unit
The minimal gated unit (MGU) is similar to the fully gated unit, except the update and reset gate vector is merged into a forget gate. This also implies that the equation for the output vector must be changed: [ 10 ]
Variables
x t {\displaystyle x_{t}} : input vector
h t {\displaystyle h_{t}} : output vector
h ^ t {\displaystyle {\hat {h}}_{t}} : candidate activation vector
f t {\displaystyle f_{t}} : forget vector
W {\displaystyle W} , U {\displaystyle U} and b {\displaystyle b} : parameter matrices and vector
Light gated recurrent unit
The light gated recurrent unit (LiGRU) [ 4 ] removes the reset gate altogether, replaces tanh with the ReLU activation, and applies batch normalization (BN):
LiGRU has been studied from a Bayesian perspective. [ 11 ] This analysis yielded a variant called light Bayesian recurrent unit (LiBRU), which showed slight improvements over the LiGRU on speech recognition tasks.
