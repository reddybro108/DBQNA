Velvet AI is a family of multilingual generative artificial intelligence models developed by Almawave, [ 3 ] an Italian company specializing in Data & Artificial Intelligence. The Velvet models, including Velvet 14B and Velvet 2B, are foundational large language models (LLMs) designed and developed entirely in Italy on Almawave's proprietary architecture. They were trained on the Leonardo supercomputer managed by CINECA and have been released in open-source format. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
The Velvet models are designed to be sustainable, emphasizing energy efficiency while maintaining high performance in real-world applications. They are capable of operating in multiple languages, including Italian, English, Spanish, Portuguese-Brazilian, German and French, with a particular emphasis on the Italian language. This multilingual capability makes them suitable for various sectors such as healthcare, social security, justice, security, mobility, finance, and public administration. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Models
Velvet 14B
Velvet 14B, the larger model with 14 billion parameters, was trained on over 4 trillion tokens across six languages, with Italian comprising approximately 23% of the data. In addition to linguistic data, Velvet incorporates over 400 billion tokens from more than 100 programming languages to facilitate more structured inferences. [ 9 ]
The development of Velvet AI reflects Almawave's strategic investment in creating high-performance, energy-efficient AI solutions that align with European regulatory frameworks. The models are ready to be used on major market platforms in the cloud, on-premise, and on the edge, and are integrated into Almawave's AIWave platform, which offers a broad portfolio of vertical AI application solutions.
