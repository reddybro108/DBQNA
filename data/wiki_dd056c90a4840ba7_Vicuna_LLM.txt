Vicuna LLM is an omnibus large language model used in AI research. [ 1 ] Its methodology is to enable the public at large to contrast and compare the accuracy of LLMs "in the wild" (an example of citizen science ) and to vote on their output; a question-and-answer chat format is used. At the beginning of each round two LLM chatbots from a  diverse pool of nine are presented randomly and anonymously, their identities only being revealed upon voting on their answers. The user has the option of either replaying ("regenerating") a round, or beginning an entirely fresh one with new LLMs. [ 2 ] (The user also has the option of choosing which LLMs to do battle.) Based on Llama 2 , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] it is an open source project, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and it itself has become the subject of academic research in the burgeoning field. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] A non-commercial, public demo of the Vicuna-13b model is available to access using LMSYS. [ 9 ]
