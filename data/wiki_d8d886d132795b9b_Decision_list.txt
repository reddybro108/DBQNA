Decision lists are a representation for Boolean functions which can be easily learnable from examples. Single term decision lists are more expressive than disjunctions and conjunctions ; however, 1-term decision lists are less expressive than the general disjunctive normal form and the conjunctive normal form .
The language specified by a k-length decision list includes as a subset the language specified by a k-depth decision tree .
Learning decision lists can be used for attribute efficient learning .
Definition
A decision list (DL) of length r is of the form:
where f i is the i th formula and b i is the i th boolean for i âˆˆ { 1... r } {\displaystyle i\in \{1...r\}} .  The last if-then-else is the default case, which means formula f r is always equal to true. A k -DL is a decision list where all of formulas have at most k terms.  Sometimes "decision list" is used to refer to a 1-DL, where all of the formulas are either a variable or its negation .
