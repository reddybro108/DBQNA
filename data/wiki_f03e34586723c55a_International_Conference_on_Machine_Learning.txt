The International Conference on Machine Learning ( ICML ) is an international academic conference in machine learning . Along with NeurIPS and ICLR , it is one of the three most respected conferences of high impact in machine learning and artificial intelligence research. [ 1 ] It is supported by the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS). Precise dates vary year to year, but paper submissions are generally due at the end of January, and the conference is generally held the following July. The first ICML was held 1980 in Pittsburgh . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
ICML has published many ground-breaking research papers that form the foundation of modern Artificial Intelligence. Some notable works include Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 's K-means clustering via PCA (ICML 2004); Google 's Batch Normalization ; Google Brain 's EfficientNet (ICML 2019); OpenAI 's Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and CLIP (ICML 2021).
ICML Sponsors
The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) attracts sponsors seeking access to ML research and talent. Technology companies such as Google , Google DeepMind , Google Brain , Waymo (Google's self-driving car), Microsoft Research , Amazon , Meta , IBM , Apple , and ByteDance are among ICML sponsors, regularly publishing their research and recruiting researchers at the conference. Financial firms and hedge funds, including but is not limited to Citadel Securities , Jane Street Capital , Hudson River Trading , and Two Sigma , also have a presence as sponsors and recruiters at ICML.
