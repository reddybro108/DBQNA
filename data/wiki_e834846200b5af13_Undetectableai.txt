Undetectable AI (or Undetectable.ai) is an artificial intelligence content detection and modification software designed to identify and alter artificially generated text, such as that produced by large language models . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
History
Undetectable AI was developed by Bars Juhasz, a PhD student from Loughborough University , along with Christian Perry, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and Devan Leos. It was publicly released in May 2023. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Reception and analysis
Undetectable AI has been discussed in technology and news outlets such as TechTudo [ 9 ] and The Inquirer , and others such as Hollywood Life and OK! Magazine . [ 1 ] [ 10 ] [ 6 ]
Academic research
Several studies have examined Undetectable AI:
In July 2023, researchers from Magna Gr√¶cia University tested Undetectable.ai against generative-text and plagiarism detection software. They found that texts processed through Undetectable.ai were significantly harder to detect as AI-generated. [ 11 ]
In November 2023, Erik Piller of Nicholls State University published a paper examining ethical implications of Undetectable AI in professional writing contexts. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
In August 2023, researchers led by Dr. Christoph Bartneck investigated how Undetectable.ai might affect data quality in online questionnaires. They found that while AI detection systems could identify ChatGPT-generated text, they were less successful with text processed by Undetectable.ai. [ 14 ]
A  research paper was also published in 2024 by Kar et al., who tested the accuracy of various online AI detection models which included Undetectable AI. [ 15 ]
Usage and impact
In November 2023, EarthWeb used Undetectable.ai alongside GPTZero to analyze online apology statements. [ 16 ] [ 10 ]
A January 2024 report listed Undetectable AI as the 35th most visited AI software in 2023 out of 150 analyzed. [ 17 ] In February 2025, Journalist David Gewirtz tested Undetectable AI's content detector to see if it could accurately identify AI-generated text. [ 18 ]
Last month, journalist Matthew Giannelis published a piece titled "Undetectable AI Becomes The New Challenge In Artificial Content Detection," [ 19 ] which documents how prevalent Undetectable AI tools have become, and the off-shoots (or copy cat startups), as well as concerns about synthetic content becoming too indistinguishable from human work.
