GPT-4.5 (codenamed " Orion ") [ 2 ] is a large language model developed by OpenAI as part of the GPT series. Officially released on February 27, 2025, GPT-4.5 is available to users subscribed to the ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans across web, mobile, and desktop platforms. [ 3 ] Access was also provided through the OpenAI API and Developer Playground until July 14, 2025. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] On August 7, 2025, with the release of GPT-5 , GPT-4.5 was removed from both the ChatGPT website and the API for all paid user tiers, as part of a broader retirement of older models. [ 7 ]
Overview
GPT-4.5 was primarily trained using unsupervised learning , which improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning. This method was combined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback . The computational resources needed for training were provided by Microsoft Azure . [ 4 ]
Sam Altman described GPT-4.5 as a "giant, expensive model". [ 8 ] [ 9 ] As of February 2025, through OpenAI's API it costs $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens, whereas GPT-4o only costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. [ 10 ]
The model was tested on the MMLU test set, which tested 15 different languages, namely Arabic , Bengali , Chinese , English , French , German , Hindi , Indonesian , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Portuguese , Spanish , Swahili , and Yoruba , with the model outperforming GPT-4o on all of them. [ 1 ] A pre-print study in March 2025 found that GPT-4.5 passed the Turing test . [ 11 ]
In April 2025, OpenAI announced that it was phasing out GPT-4.5 from API access in favor of GPT-4.1 , set to take effect on July 14. [ 5 ]
Reception
GPT-4.5 was mostly seen by reviewers as an incremental upgrade over GPT-4o . Cade Metz, writing for The New York Times , stated that the model "signifies the end of an era" as it is their last chatbot to not do chain of thought reasoning . The Times also said it was "unlikely to generate as much excitement as GPT-4". [ 12 ] Eric Schwartz from TechRadar praised its ability to understand subtext and respond to questions in a more humanlike manner compared to GPT-4o, but concluded that "it doesn't feel like an enormous leap" from the prior model. [ 13 ] Aaron Levie , the CEO of cloud services company Box , told Axios that GPT-4.5 is "about 20% better" than GPT-4o on specific tasks, such as information extraction in large datasets. [ 14 ]
