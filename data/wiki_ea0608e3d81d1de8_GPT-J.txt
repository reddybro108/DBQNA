GPT-J or GPT-J-6B is an open-source large language model (LLM) developed by EleutherAI in 2021. [ 1 ] As the name suggests, it is a generative pre-trained transformer model designed to produce human-like text that continues from a prompt. The optional "6B" in the name refers to the fact that it has 6 billion parameters. [ 2 ] The model is available on GitHub , but the web interface no longer communicates with the model. Development stopped in 2021. [ 3 ]
Architecture
GPT-J is a GPT-3 -like model with 6 billion parameters. [ 4 ] Like GPT-3, it is an autoregressive , decoder-only transformer model designed to solve natural language processing (NLP) tasks by predicting how a piece of text will continue. [ 1 ]
Its architecture differs from GPT-3 in three main ways. [ 1 ]
The attention and feedforward neural network were computed in parallel during training, allowing for greater efficiency.
The GPT-J model uses rotary position embeddings , which has been found to be a superior method of injecting positional information into transformers. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
GPT-J uses dense attention instead of efficient sparse attention, as used in GPT-3.
Beyond that, the model has 28 transformer layers and 16 attention heads. Its vocabulary size is 50257 tokens , the same size as GPT-2 's. [ 2 ] It has a context window size of 2048 tokens. [ 7 ]
It was trained on the Pile dataset, [ 2 ] [ 4 ] using the Mesh Transformer JAX library in JAX to handle the parallelization scheme. [ 2 ] [ 8 ]
Performance
GPT-J was designed to generate English text from a prompt. It was not designed for translating or generating text in other languages or for performance without first fine-tuning the model for a specific task. [ 2 ] Nonetheless, GPT-J performs reasonably well even without fine-tuning, even in translation (at least from English to French). [ 9 ]
When neither is fine-tuned, GPT-J-6B performs almost as well as the 6.7 billion parameter GPT-3 (Curie) on a variety of tasks. [ 4 ] It even outperforms the 175 billion parameter GPT-3 (Davinci) on code generation tasks. [ 10 ] With fine-tuning, it outperforms an untuned GPT-3 (Davinci) on a number of tasks. [ 1 ]
Like all LLMs, it is not programmed to give factually accurate information, only to generate text based on probability. [ 2 ]
Applications
The untuned GPT-J is available on EleutherAI's website, [ 11 ] NVIDIA 's Triton Inference Server, [ 12 ] and NLP Cloud's website. [ 13 ] Cerebras [ 1 ] and Amazon Web Services [ 14 ] [ 15 ] offer services to fine-tune the GPT-J model for company-specific tasks. Graphcore offers both fine-tuning and hosting services for the untuned GPT-J, as well as offering to host the fine-tuned models after they are produced. [ 16 ] CoreWeave offers hosting services for both the untuned GPT-J and fine-tuned variants. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
In March 2023, Databricks released Dolly, an Apache-licensed , instruction-following model created by fine-tuning GPT-J on the Stanford Alpaca dataset. [ 19 ] NovelAI 's Sigurd [ 20 ] and Genji-JP 6B [ 21 ] models are both fine-tuned versions of GPT-J. They also offer further fine-tuning services to produce and host custom models. [ 22 ]
EleutherAI has received praise from Cerebras, [ 1 ] GPT-3 Demo, [ 4 ] NLP Cloud, [ 13 ] and Databricks [ 19 ] for making the model open-source, and its open-source status is often cited as a major advantage when choosing which model to use. [ 10 ] [ 16 ] [ 23 ]
