Recraft is a generative artificial intelligence program and service developed by the London-based startup Recraft, Inc. Like models such as Midjourney and DALL-E , it generates digital images from natural language prompts, but is specifically tailored for professional design workflows, with features that emphasize brand consistency, text fidelity, and layout control. [ 1 ]
History and background
Recraft, Inc. was founded in 2022 by machine learning scientist Anna Veronika Dorogush, best known for co-creating the CatBoost machine learning library at Yandex. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
The company emerged from stealth on May 31, 2023, with a public release of its vector graphics generation capability on Product Hunt . On January 17, 2024, TechCrunch profiled Recraft’s foundational model for graphic design, noting its emphasis on addressing copyright and ethical concerns associated with AI-generated imagery. [ 1 ]
On October 28, 2024, TechCrunch reported that Recraft's third major model, V3, had topped a crowdsourced benchmark, surpassing Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E in overall image quality. [ 4 ]
On May 5, 2025, Recraft announced a $30 million Series B funding round led by Accel, reporting more than four million registered users at the time of the announcement. [ 5 ]
Technology
Recraft has not publicly disclosed the detailed technical architecture of its model. However, third-party reviews and benchmarks have noted that its performance resembles diffusion-based systems such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
The model is designed for creative workflows requiring visual consistency and flexible output formats. Reviewers have noted its ability to generate legible multi-line text, [ 7 ] produce high-resolution imagery at various canvas sizes, [ 8 ] and to maintain alignment with user-defined brand palettes and design themes. [ 5 ]
Though not open-source, Recraft offers its functionalities through a web interface and commercial API. Advanced features such as style settings and positioning control differentiate it from general-purpose text-to-image tools. [ 5 ]
