Lyra is a lossy audio codec developed by Google that is designed for compressing speech at very low bitrates. Unlike most other audio formats, it compresses data using a machine learning -based algorithm.
Features
The Lyra codec is designed to transmit speech in real-time when bandwidth is severely restricted, such as over slow or unreliable network connections. [ 1 ] It runs at fixed bitrates of 3.2, 6, and 9 kbit/s and it is intended to provide better quality than codecs that use traditional waveform-based algorithms at similar bitrates. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Instead, compression is achieved via a machine learning algorithm that encodes the input with feature extraction, and then reconstructs an approximation of the original using a generative model. [ 1 ] This model was trained on thousands of hours of speech recorded in over 70 languages to function with various speakers. [ 2 ] Because generative models are more computationally complex than traditional codecs, a simple model that processes different frequency ranges in parallel is used to obtain acceptable performance. [ 4 ] Lyra imposes 20 ms of latency due to its frame size. [ 3 ] Google's reference implementation is available for Android and Linux . [ 4 ]
Quality
Lyra's initial version performed significantly better than traditional codecs at similar bitrates. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Ian Buckley at MakeUseOf said, "It succeeds in creating almost eerie levels of audio reproduction with bitrates as low as 3 kbps." Google claims that it reproduces natural-sounding speech, and that Lyra at 3 kbit/s beats Opus at 8 kbit/s. [ 2 ] Tsahi Levent-Levi writes that Satin , Microsoft's AI-based codec, outperforms it at higher bitrates. [ 5 ]
History
In December 2017, Google researchers published a preprint paper on replacing the Codec 2 decoder with a WaveNet neural network. They found that a neural network is able to extrapolate features of the voice not described in the Codec 2 bitstream and give better audio quality, and that the use of conventional features makes the neural network calculation simpler compared to a purely waveform-based network. Lyra version 1 would reuse this overall framework of feature extraction, quantization, and neural synthesis. [ 6 ]
Lyra was first announced in February 2021, [ 2 ] and in April, Google released the source code of their reference implementation. [ 1 ] The initial version had a fixed bitrate of 3 kbit/s and around 90 ms latency. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The encoder calculates a log mel spectrogram and performs vector quantization to store the spectrogram in a data stream. The decoder is a WaveNet neural network that takes the spectrogram and reconstructs the input audio. [ 2 ]
A second version (v2/1.2.0), released in September 2022, improved sound quality, latency, and performance, and permitted multiple bitrates. V2 uses a "SoundStream" structure where both the encoder and decoder are neural networks, a kind of autoencoder . A residual vector quantizer is used to turn the feature values into transferrable data. [ 3 ]
Support
Implementations
Google's implementation is available on GitHub under the Apache License. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] Written in C++ , it is optimized for 64-bit ARM but also runs on x86 , on either Android or Linux. [ 4 ]
Applications
Google Meet uses Lyra to transmit sound for video chats when bandwidth is limited. [ 1 ] [ 5 ]
