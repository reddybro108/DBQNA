H Company , also known simply as H , is a French artificial intelligence startup which develops "action-oriented" artificial intelligence agents for enterprise automation and productivity. In May 2024, H Company closed a record-setting $220 million Series B, at the time the largest AI raise in Europe .
History
H Company was created in 2023 by Charles Kantor and four DeepMind veterans: Laurent Sifre (participated in the AlphaGo research program), Daan Wiestra (founding member of Google DeepMind ), Karl Tuyls (specialized in multi-agent systems), and Julien Perollat (specialized in multi-agent systems and game theory ).
In May 2024, the firm secured what was then the largest European AI seed round, totaling $220 million led by US investors including Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO), Amazon , and backed by Accel , Bpifrance , UiPath , Eurazeo , Xavier Niel , Yuri Milner , Bernard Arnault , Samsung and others. President Emmanuel Macron publicly congratulated the achievement on social media.
By August 2024 three founding researchers—Wiestra, Tuyls and Perollat—had to depart over operational disagreements. In November 2024 H launched Runner H , its first agentic-API platform. In June 2025 the company unveiled three new agentic models. Later that month, founder-CEO Charles Kantor stepped down, succeeded by Gautier Cloix. aiming to pivot H Company toward an "agentic services" model. [ citation needed ] In July 2025, H Company introduced Surfer-H-CLI , an open-source, web-native Chrome agent designed for browser-based automation—able to search, scroll, click, and type on behalf of users and controllable via any visual language model (VLM). When paired with its June 2025 open-sourced 3B-parameter Holo-1 model, Surfer-H-CLI achieved 92.2% WebVoyager benchmark accuracy.
