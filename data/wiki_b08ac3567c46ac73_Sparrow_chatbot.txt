Sparrow is a chatbot developed by the artificial intelligence research lab DeepMind , a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. It is designed to answer users' questions correctly, while reducing the risk of unsafe and inappropriate answers. [ 1 ] One motivation behind Sparrow is to address the problem of language models producing incorrect, biased or potentially harmful outputs. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Sparrow is trained using human judgements, in order to be more “Helpful, Correct and Harmless” compared to baseline pre-trained language models. [ 1 ] The development of Sparrow involved asking paid study participants to interact with Sparrow, and collecting their preferences to train a model of how useful an answer is. [ 2 ]
To improve accuracy and help avoid the problem of hallucinating incorrect answers, Sparrow has the ability to search the Internet using Google Search [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] in order to find and cite evidence for any factual claims it makes.
To make the model safer, its behaviour is constrained by a set of rules, for example "don't make threatening statements" and "don't make hateful or insulting comments", as well as rules about possibly harmful advice, and not claiming to be a person. [ 1 ] During development study participants were asked to converse with the system and try to trick it into breaking these rules. [ 2 ] A 'rule model' was trained on judgements from these participants, which was used for further training.
Sparrow was introduced in a paper in September 2022, titled "Improving alignment of dialogue agents via targeted human judgements"; [ 4 ] however, the bot was not released publicly. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said DeepMind is considering releasing Sparrow for a "private beta" some time in 2023. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Training
Sparrow is a deep neural network based on the transformer machine learning model architecture. It is fine-tuned from DeepMind's Chinchilla AI pre-trained large language model (LLM), [ 1 ] which has 70 Billion parameters. [ 7 ]
Sparrow is trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), [ 1 ] [ 3 ] although some supervised fine-tuning techniques are also used. The RLHF training utilizes two reward models to capture human judgements: a “preference model” that predicts what a human study participant would prefer and a “rule model” that predicts if the model has broken one of the rules. [ 3 ]
Limitations
Sparrow's training data corpus is mainly in English, meaning it performs worse in other languages. [ citation needed ]
When adversarially probed by study participants it breaks the rules 8% of the time; [ 2 ] however, this is still three times lower than the baseline prompted pre-trained model (Chinchilla).
